#Design Choices for the project

The purpose of this website is to provide a professional profile for each of the "members" of this company. Though much of the content is just ironic use of buzzwords, the professional appeal of the site is intended to be used so that the "members" have a place to put professional portfolios.

The target audiences of this website are either hiring managers, job interviewers, and passerby's looking for a short laugh.

The varying degrees of gray are to maintain a professional black-on-white without appearing too default. The varying degrees of blue along the header are used to make the header's components appear distinct while still making it appear as one unit. The opening (stock) image with generic motto-sounding text was used because it is a common trend in professional-looking websites.

Alex has requested that most elements have a box shadow. This helps to make some elements float and make them stand out.

Alex has provided the text for some of the website's content already. However, it is only plain text. He also provided the logo, the jigsaw-gear picture.

Note: Though Brent and Kalvn have "web" in their names, Todd actually programmed the site independently. The SyScI names were chosen on a separate occasion.
